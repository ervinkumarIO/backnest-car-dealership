## üìù Notes for Frontend Integration

### General Integration
1. **Base URL**: Always use `http://localhost:3000/api/v1` as the base URL
2. **Authentication**: Use the unified login endpoint `/auth/login` for automatic user type detection
3. **File Uploads**: Use multipart/form-data for direct uploads, presigned URLs for S3 uploads
4. **Error Handling**: Check response status codes and handle errors appropriately
5. **Pagination**: Use query parameters for paginated endpoints
6. **CORS**: Backend is configured for cross-origin requests from multiple origins including `http://localhost:5173` (Vite), `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:3001`, `http://localhost:8080`, and `http://localhost:4200`

### Dashboard Table Integration
7. **Primary Endpoint**: Use `/cars/listing` for dashboard table data (not `/cars`)
8. **Query Parameters**: Support both formats - `status[eq]=In Stock` and `status=In Stock`
9. **Search**: Searches across brand, model, variant, chassisNo, and color fields
10. **Response Format**: Dashboard listing returns `{ data, currentPage, lastPage, total }` format
11. **Statistics**: Use `/cars/stats` for dashboard summary cards
12. **Bulk Operations**: All bulk endpoints return `{ message, updatedCount/deletedCount }` format
13. **Real-time Updates**: Implement optimistic updates with rollback on API failure
14. **Debounced Search**: Implement 500ms debounce on search input to avoid excessive API calls

### Data Types & Validation
15. **Car Status**: "In Stock", "Sold", "On Order", "In Transit", "Reserved"
16. **Car Condition**: "New", "Used", "Certified Pre-Owned", "Recon"
17. **Public Visibility**: "yes" or "no" (string values)
18. **Price**: Numeric values in MYR
19. **Features**: Array of strings
20. **Images**: Array of S3 URLs
